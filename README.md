# Course-evolution-system

This application is used to get feedback from students for a particular course.

First a course teacher will make some randon token by this application and distribute these randomly to the students. Students will get this token and login to the system to give their feedback. These tokens can be used one time.So if any one can use this token for one feedback only. By this way the course teacher can not be able to know the author of a particular feedback.
